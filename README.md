### Cops and Robber :police_car:
Some cops want to catch a rubber, and we want to simulate it. There is a square table that cops and robber move in its cells. Each cell can contain only one person, and when a cop moves into a robber's cell, the robber will be arrested. Use a random function for their movement.
