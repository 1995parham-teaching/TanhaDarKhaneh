## Introduction
Coronavirus makes all of us stay home and cancel all classes.
Here we want to demonstrate C programming with example projects and codes.
These codes have companion videos that are available on youtube.
These materials can be used with [C Programming Lectures](https://ce101.aut-ce.page/).

## Review
These videos reviews on some important points of C programming practically.

## Projects
### Phone Book :iphone:
Phone book application stores user identification and phones as integers.
It has an uncomplicated menu, and users can add, get, and remove entities.

1. Write a simple version only with Loop and Decision.[Video](https://youtu.be/i7tPhMz1BXM)
2. Use functions to reduce the complexity of code. [Video](https://youtu.be/msOIwGQukgY)

### Cops and Robber :police_car:
Some cops want to catch a rubber, and we want to simulate it. There is a square table that cops and robber move in its cells. Each cell can contain only one person, and when a cop moves into a robber's cell, the robber will be arrested. Use a random function for their movement.
